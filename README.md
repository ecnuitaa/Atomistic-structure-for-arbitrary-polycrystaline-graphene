# Atomistic-structure-for-arbitrary-polycrystaline-graphene
Inspired by the algorithm proposed by Ophus et. al. in their paper titled "Large-Scale Experimental and Theoretical Study of Graphene Grain Boundary Structures", 2015, this study is aimed to create a novel python script to generate atomistic structures of polycrystalline graphene with arbitrary grain distributions like gradient grain size
